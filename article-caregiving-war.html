                    <p>Korean society is entering what I call the "caregiving society." With rapid aging and increased
                        life expectancy, every elderly household is now burdened with caregiving responsibilities. This
                        article explores why the Korean church must pay attention to this growing crisis.</p>

                    <h2>The Coming Caregiving Crisis</h2>
                    <p>As Korea transitions into a super-aged society, caregiving has become more than a family
                        matter—it's evolving into a full-scale "caregiving war." Medical advances have brought us into
                        an age of longevity, but many elderly illnesses require long-term care, creating what I call
                        "endless diseases of longevity."</p>

                    <p>This burden falls not only on the elderly themselves but heavily on their families. Dual-income
                        couples often have no choice but to outsource parent care, but even this solution has its
                        limits. The strain creates family conflicts and spreads into broader social problems.</p>

                    <h2>The Reality of Longevity</h2>
                    <p>Extended lifespans are not always a blessing. When longevity comes with chronic illness and
                        dependency, it can become a source of suffering rather than joy. We must acknowledge this
                        reality honestly and prepare accordingly.</p>

                    <h2>The National and Social Burden</h2>
                    <p>The responsibilities that society and the state must shoulder have grown tremendously. Healthcare
                        costs, long-term care insurance, and support systems for caregivers all require significant
                        resources. But beyond policy and budgets, we need communities of compassion and practical
                        support.</p>

                    <h2>The Church's Role</h2>
                    <p>This is where the Korean church must step in. Caregiving ministry—caring for both the elderly and
                        their caregivers—should be a priority. The church can provide:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Respite care programs for exhausted family caregivers</li>
                        <li>Training and support groups for those caring for loved ones</li>
                        <li>Spiritual counseling and prayer support</li>
                        <li>Practical help through volunteers and community networks</li>
                        <li>Advocacy for better caregiving policies and resources</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h2>A Ministry of Blessing</h2>
                    <p>In my book <em>The Blessing of Caregiving</em> (『간병의 축복』), I explore how caregiving, despite its
                        challenges, can become a ministry of love and blessing. When the church embraces this calling,
                        we demonstrate Christ's compassion in tangible ways.</p>

                    <p>The "caregiving war" ahead will intensify. But it also presents the church with an opportunity to
                        shine Christ's light in the midst of suffering, to support the vulnerable, and to model the kind
                        of community God intended—one where we bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of
                        Christ.</p>

                    <p>Will the Korean church rise to meet this challenge? The time to act is now.</p>
