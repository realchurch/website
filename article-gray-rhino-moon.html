                    <p>What do cotton seeds and modern entrepreneurship have in common? More than you might think. In
                        Chapter 10 of my book <em>David Before the Gray Rhino</em>, I explore the "Moon Ik-jeom
                        Project"—a historical case study with profound lessons for today's business leaders and
                        Christians navigating an uncertain world.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding the Gray Rhino</h2>
                    <p>The term "gray rhino," coined by Michele Wucker at the 2013 Davos Forum, describes highly
                        probable, high-impact threats that we choose to ignore or downplay. Unlike "black swans"
                        (unpredictable surprises), gray rhinos are visible and approaching—yet we often fail to prepare
                        for them.</p>

                    <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution, demographic shifts, climate change, and pandemics like COVID-19
                        are all gray rhinos. We see them coming, but do we respond appropriately?</p>

                    <h2>Moon Ik-jeom: Korea's First Entrepreneur</h2>
                    <p>In the late Goryeo period, Moon Ik-jeom (문익점) traveled to Yuan China as a diplomat. When he
                        returned, he secretly brought back cotton seeds hidden in his brush handle—a bold and risky move
                        that would transform Korean society.</p>

                    <p>Before cotton, Koreans relied on hemp and silk for clothing. Cotton was revolutionary: warmer,
                        more durable, and accessible to common people. Moon Ik-jeom didn't just import seeds; he:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Established the foundation for Korea's cotton industry</li>
                        <li>Developed new weaving tools and techniques</li>
                        <li>Made quality clothing available to all social classes</li>
                        <li>Created an entirely new economic sector</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I argue that Moon Ik-jeom was Korea's first true entrepreneur—someone who identified a societal
                        need, took risks to address it, and created lasting value through innovation.</p>

                    <h2>Lessons for Christian Entrepreneurs</h2>
                    <p>My book <em>David Before the Gray Rhino</em> presents 33 core entrepreneurial principles for
                        Christian business leaders navigating the massive changes of our era. The Moon Ik-jeom Project
                        illustrates several key points:</p>

                    <h3>1. See What Others Miss</h3>
                    <p>Moon Ik-jeom recognized the transformative potential of cotton when others saw just a plant.
                        Christian entrepreneurs must cultivate discernment to identify coming changes and opportunities.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Take Calculated Risks</h3>
                    <p>Smuggling cotton seeds was dangerous, but Moon calculated that the potential benefit outweighed
                        the risk. We must be willing to step out in faith when God opens doors.</p>

                    <h3>3. Think Long-Term</h3>
                    <p>Moon didn't just plant seeds for himself—he established an industry that would serve generations.
                        Christian business should create lasting value, not just quick profits.</p>

                    <h3>4. Serve the Common Good</h3>
                    <p>Cotton clothing became accessible to everyone, not just the elite. Businesses operating "in
                        Jesus' name" should prioritize service and social benefit alongside profit.</p>

                    <h3>5. Embrace Innovation</h3>
                    <p>Moon developed new tools and techniques. We must be willing to adapt, learn, and innovate to meet
                        the challenges of our rapidly changing world.</p>

                    <h2>Facing Today's Gray Rhinos</h2>
                    <p>Just as Moon Ik-jeom prepared Korea for a textile revolution, Christian entrepreneurs today must
                        prepare for the gray rhinos charging toward us: technological disruption, climate change,
                        demographic shifts, and more.</p>

                    <p>The question isn't whether these changes are coming—they are. The question is: Will we board the
                        ark before the flood, or will we be swept away?</p>

                    <p>The Moon Ik-jeom Project teaches us that one person, acting with vision and courage, can
                        transform an entire society. What cotton seeds might God be calling you to plant today?</p>
